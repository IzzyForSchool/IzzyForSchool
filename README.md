- Hello, I'm @IzzyForSchool, I'm part of CHS's AP Computer Science class, but I actually go to CV.
- My name is actually Izzy. I also like being called Rysta :]
- I love art and programming. I hope to use my skills in both to make games myself 
- I'm currently learning Java nad JavaScript.
- Right now I'm not looking to collaborate, but if you'd like to help me test a project I've been working on that would be nice!
- On most platforms I'm RystaTheSimp, Rysta_The_Simp, or Rysta-The-Simp, but I'm not the most active person.
- Pronouns: Please ask me! Thank you.
- Fun fact: Did you know sea bunnies (a type of sea slug) steal the stingers of jellyfish and use them against predators!
